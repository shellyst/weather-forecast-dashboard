# Weather Dashboard - Server-Side APIs

## This project was created for Week 6: Weather Dashboard Challenge.

This dashboard was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, OpenWeather API, Bootstrap, and Moment.js, and performs the following functionality:

1. When a user searches for a city, they are presented with the current and future conditions for that city, and the city is added to the search history.

2. When the current weather conditions for the city are viewed, user is presented with city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidty, the wind speed, and the UV index.

3. When the UV index is viewed, user is presented with a colour that indicates weather conditions as favourable, moderate, or severe.

4. When a used views the future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

5. When a city is clicked in the search history, user is once again presented with the current and future conditions for that city.
